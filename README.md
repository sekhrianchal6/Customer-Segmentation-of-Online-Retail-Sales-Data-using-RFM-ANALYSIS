Customer segmentation using RFM analysis is a popular approach in marketing and customer analytics. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, which are three key metrics used to categorize and understand customer behavior and value. The goal of RFM analysis is to group customers into segments based on their purchasing patterns, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to each segment's specific needs.

Here's a breakdown of each component of RFM analysis:

Recency (R): Recency refers to the time since a customer's last purchase. Customers who have made recent purchases are often more engaged and responsive, indicating higher potential for future sales. Recency is typically measured in terms of days or months since the last transaction.

Frequency (F): Frequency represents the number of purchases made by a customer within a specific timeframe. Customers who make frequent purchases are likely to be loyal and have a higher customer lifetime value. Frequency can be measured as the number of transactions within a given period, such as a month or a year.

Monetary Value (M): Monetary Value represents the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases. Customers who have made larger purchases or have a higher average order value tend to be more valuable to the business. Monetary Value can be calculated by summing up the total revenue generated by a customer.
